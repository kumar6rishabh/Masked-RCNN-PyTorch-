# Masked-RCNN-PyTorch-
PyTorch implementation of the Masked RCNN for Image segmentation.

This project aims at using the Masked RCNN api from PyTorch for the purposes of object detection and also image segmentation. In the project,  we use the pedestrain dataset and try to find the number of people in the image and also segment them using the Masked RCNN PyTorch api.
